        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p class="objText">
        The briefing was to develop a whole campaign for the Ontario Organ Donation, from social media and visual 
        identity, to marketing and a mobile first website.
        </p>
        <h1>The concept</h1>
        <p class="objText">
        The concept of our campaign is focused around showing people how many lives they can save or improve 
        by being organ donors, how easy it is to register and how important this decision can be. We decided 
        to target people's emotions by giving names and faces to the organ recipients, so people can empathize 
        and get inspired.

        <h1>Creative Process</h1>
        <p class="objText">
        We played around with numerous names until we settled on the name Thanks 2 one, always keeping the concept 
        present and strong. For the logo, first we decided to focus on a heart beat or some other symbol that would make it obvious 
        what it is about. After playing a lot with typography and symbolism, we decided that being obvious wasn't 
        the best way, so we simplified it more and more until we had only two different very strong typographies. 
        For our color palette we established that we would keep the background dark, to make it stand out about the 
        competition, that usually focus on white backgrounds, and for the details we chose a shade of green.

            <h1>The marketing</h1>
            <p class="objText">
            To advertise the campaing and bring more awereness, we decided to create a main poster with the photo 
            of the recipient, his/her name and how many people were saved. The intention is to chock a little and 
            make people talk about it, empathize. For starters we would organize an event with a truck where you can 
            register right away. The event would be comprised as well of food trucks and grafitti arts so people can 
            take photos and help spread the word. We would also create profiles on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and 
            Youtube, and try to partner up with influencers, to spread our hashtag: #thanks2one. Keeping the event 
            concept, another idea would be to hire grafitti artists to paint the hashtag all over Ontario.

        <h1>The Result</h1>
        <p class="objText">
        After finishing the logo, we developed the rest of the brand identity. We chose a pattern for the backgrounds, 
        focusing on the tiles we would have on the wall of our restaurants, and the eco friendly fabric we would use 
        for our uniforms and aprons. Eco Culinarius would also be comprised of a mobile app, so you could order online 
        and check out our menu and promotions.
